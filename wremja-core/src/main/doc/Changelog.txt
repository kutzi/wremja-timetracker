- fixed initial directory in im-/export dialogs to point to 'My Documents' resp. home directory

- improved tray icon handling on Linux/Gnome
- some more minor changes

Cumulative changes in Version 1.0 (Compared to Baralga 1.3.5 resp. 1.4)
=======================================================================

- overhauled UI
  - easier tray menu handling: no confirmation dialogs
  - nicer UI (especially on Linux)
  - avoid absolute sizing of windows/dialogs, which improves cross-platform usability
  - fixed 'popup menus not shown' on Linux
  - more complete mnemonics in menus
  - new Look & Feel
  - remember main window's location and minimized state (optionally)
  - remember last select tab in the 'category' tabs
  - allow deletion of multiple activities at once

- improved saving algorithm
  - changes to data are now detected and saved more quickly. Therefore data loss can occur is more improbable.

- Installer
  - reduced installer size from ~9 MB to ~7.5 MB without losing any functionality
  - improved Linux installer (can now install application menu entries)
  - installer checks Java requirements (>= 1.6) before proceeding

- recognition of unstopped activities in case of a 'dirty' previous shutdown

- include current activity in the time per day/time per week calculation

- 'current' week and month filters work like they should do (IMHO). I.e. they filter out previous years.

- discard 'empty' activities (optionally)

- lots more
