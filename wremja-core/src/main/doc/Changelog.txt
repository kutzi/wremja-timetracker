Changes in Version 1.0 (Compared to Baralga 1.3.5 resp. 1.4)
============================================================

- overhauled UI
  - easier tray menu handling: no confirmation dialogs
  - nicer UI (especially on Linux)
  - avoid absolute sizing of windows/dialogs, which should improve cross-platform usability
  - fixed 'popup menus not shown' on Linux
  - new Look & Feel
  - remember main window's location and minimized state (optionally)
  - allow deletion of multiple activities at once

- improved saving algorithm
  - changes to data are now detected and saved more quickly. Therefore less data loss can occur.

- reduced installer size from ~9 MB to ~2 MB without losing any functionality!

- improved Linux installer (can now install application menu entries)

- recognition of unstopped activities due to a 'dirty' previous shutdown

- include current activity in the time per day/time per week calculation

- 'current' week and month filters work like they should do (IMHO). I.e. they filter previous years.

- discard 'empty' activities (optionally)

- lots more
