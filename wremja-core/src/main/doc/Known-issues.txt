Known issues in Wremja
======================

- Activities are not stopped, when the computer is shut down

There seems to be nothing we can do about it, since Java itself doesn't get informed about the shutdown.
However, Wremja recognizes unfinished activities on next startup and asks how to proceed with them.

- Desktop icon creation doesn't work on Linux

- Repeated installation on Linux creates additional main menu entries

- tray icon issues on Linux
  - background of the icon is always gray
  - Minimizing to/restoring from tray icon doesn't work reliably (on Gnome).
    Therefore the tray icon is disabled per default when running under Gnome

- No installer for Mac OS

- Activities over midnight:
You cannot have activities lasting over midnight. Instead 2 activities are created:
One from start to midnight and one from midnight to end.
